# Address Verification Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

All location and address inputs across the application have been upgraded with smart address verification using Google Places API.

## Files Created

### Components
- **`/src/components/ui/AddressInput.tsx`** - Reusable address input component with autocomplete and verification
- **`/src/components/GoogleMapsProvider.tsx`** - Provider component for loading Google Maps API
- **`/src/lib/googleMaps.ts`** - Utility for loading Google Maps JavaScript API

### Documentation
- **`/guides/ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup and usage guide
- **`/guides/ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file
- **`/env.example.txt`** - Environment variable template

### Tests
- **`/src/components/ui/__tests__/AddressInput.test.tsx`** - Unit tests for AddressInput component

## Files Modified

### Updated to Use AddressInput Component

1. **`/src/components/casting/AuditionDetailsForm.tsx`**
   - Rehearsal Location field
   - Performance Location field

2. **`/src/app/company/page.tsx`**
   - Company Address field

3. **`/src/components/casting/SlotScheduler.tsx`**
   - Default Location field for audition slots

## Features Implemented

✅ **Autocomplete Suggestions** - Real-time address suggestions as users type  
✅ **Address Verification** - Visual feedback with checkmark for verified addresses  
✅ **Geocoding** - Latitude/longitude data for verified addresses  
✅ **Debounced API Calls** - Optimized to reduce API usage  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation when API is unavailable  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile  
✅ **Accessibility** - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation  
✅ **Unit Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage  

## Setup Required

### 1. Get Google Maps API Key

Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and:
- Create a project
- Enable Places API and Maps JavaScript API
- Create an API key
- Restrict the key to your domain

### 2. Add Environment Variable

Create `.env.local` file:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. User starts typing an address
2. After 300ms debounce, Google Places API is queried
3. Suggestions appear in a dropdown
4. User selects a suggestion
5. Address is verified and geocoded
6. Green checkmark indicates verification
7. Formatted address is saved

## Fallback Behavior

If Google Maps API is not configured:
- Component works as a standard text input
- No errors are thrown
- Users can still enter addresses manually
- Console warning is logged

## Cost Considerations

Google Maps Platform pricing:
- **Autocomplete**: ~$2.83 per 1,000 sessions
- **Place Details**: ~$17 per 1,000 requests
- **Free tier**: $200 credit per month

The implementation uses session tokens to optimize costs.

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test AddressInput
```

Manual testing checklist:
- [ ] Type partial address
- [ ] Verify suggestions appear
- [ ] Select a suggestion
- [ ] Confirm green checkmark appears
- [ ] Verify formatted address is displayed
- [ ] Test without API key (should work as standard input)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Offline address caching
- Map preview for selected addresses
- Extract address components (street, city, state, zip)
- International address support
- Custom validation rules

## Support

For detailed information, see:
- `/guides/ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_SETUP.md` - Full setup guide
- Google Maps Platform documentation
- Browser console for error messages

## Notes

- The AddressInput component is fully reusable
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Graceful degradation ensures app works without API key
- Unit tests ensure reliability

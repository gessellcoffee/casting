# Company Creation Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete company creation and management feature that allows authenticated users to create, view, edit, and delete their own companies.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Database Types (`src/lib/supabase/types.ts`)
- Added `companies` table type definition matching your Supabase schema
- Added type exports: `Company`, `CompanyInsert`, `CompanyUpdate`
- Includes all fields: company_id, creator_user_id, name, description, address, vision, mission, values, image_gallery, created_at

### 2. Database Functions (`src/lib/supabase/company.ts`) - NEW FILE
Created comprehensive database functions with security checks:
- `getCompany(companyId)` - Fetch a single company by ID
- `getUserCompanies(userId)` - Get all companies created by a user
- `createCompany(companyData)` - Create a new company (auto-sets creator_user_id)
- `updateCompany(companyId, updates)` - Update company (with ownership verification)
- `deleteCompany(companyId)` - Delete company (with ownership verification)
- `isCompanyNameAvailable(name, userId)` - Check if company name is available for a user

**Security Features:**
- All write operations verify user authentication
- Update and delete operations verify ownership before allowing changes
- Prevents users from modifying other users' companies

### 3. Tests (`src/lib/supabase/__tests__/company.test.ts`) - NEW FILE
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Authenticated users can create companies
- ✅ Unauthenticated requests are rejected
- ✅ Users can update their own companies
- ✅ Users cannot update other users' companies
- ✅ Users can delete their own companies
- ✅ Users cannot delete other users' companies
- ✅ Authorization checks work correctly

### 4. Company Page (`src/app/company/page.tsx`) - NEW FILE
Full-featured company management UI with:
- **List View**: Display all user's companies
- **Create Form**: Create new companies with all fields
- **Edit Form**: Edit existing companies
- **Delete**: Delete companies with confirmation
- **Image Gallery**: Upload and manage company images
- **Validation**: Required field validation
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Success Notifications**: Confirmation messages for actions

**Form Fields:**
- Name (required)
- Description
- Address
- Vision
- Mission
- Values
- Image Gallery (using existing ImageGalleryUpload component)

### 5. Navigation Bar (`src/components/NavigationBar.tsx`)
- Added "Company" link to desktop navigation (visible only when logged in)
- Added "Company" link to mobile navigation menu (visible only when logged in)

### 6. Index Export (`src/lib/supabase/index.ts`)
- Added export for company functions

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Log in to the application
2. Click "Company" in the navigation bar
3. Click "Create Company" button
4. Fill in company details (name is required)
5. Upload images if desired
6. Click "Save" to create the company
7. View all your companies in the list
8. Edit or delete companies as needed

### For Developers:
```typescript
import { createCompany, getUserCompanies, updateCompany, deleteCompany } from '@/lib/supabase/company';

// Create a company
const { data, error } = await createCompany({
  name: 'My Theater Company',
  description: 'A community theater',
  vision: 'To bring theater to everyone',
});

// Get user's companies
const companies = await getUserCompanies(userId);

// Update a company
const { data, error } = await updateCompany(companyId, {
  description: 'Updated description',
});

// Delete a company
const { error } = await deleteCompany(companyId);
```

## Security Considerations
- All database operations verify user authentication
- Users can only modify/delete their own companies
- The `creator_user_id` is automatically set from the authenticated user
- Authorization checks prevent unauthorized access

## Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test company.test.ts
```

## Database Schema Match
The implementation matches your Supabase schema exactly:
- ✅ company_id (uuid, auto-generated)
- ✅ creator_user_id (uuid, auto-set from auth.uid())
- ✅ name (varchar(255), required)
- ✅ description (text, nullable)
- ✅ address (varchar(255), nullable)
- ✅ vision (text, nullable)
- ✅ mission (text, nullable)
- ✅ values (text, nullable)
- ✅ image_gallery (jsonb, nullable)
- ✅ created_at (timestamp, auto-set)
- ✅ Foreign key to profiles table

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. Add company search/filter functionality
2. Add company public profiles
3. Add team member management
4. Add company-specific auditions/casting calls
5. Add company analytics/statistics
